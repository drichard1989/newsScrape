# newsScrape

AppleInsider Scraper is an application that allows you to scrape the articles off of Appleinsider.com, and populate the main page. Using a series of validations, articles only populate once on the page. You can save the article for future review, and once that article is saved, you can write notes and comments about that article.
This project was completed using Mongoose and MongoDB, which is where the data is being stored. The notes are tied to the articles in MongoDB. Incorportating Mongoose and MongoDB was different than using MySQL, but showed benefits and drawbacks.
